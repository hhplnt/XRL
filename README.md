An Overleaf report created for the Data Science Toolbox module at the University of Bristol. This report focuses on Variational inference, specifically mean field coordinate ascent and its applications.

The report is structured as follows:

1. Context - linking the content of the report to the module content and cybersecurity domain
2. Background - introducing the method and its history 
3. Method - a mathematical description of the coordinate ascent algorithm 
4. Usage - an overview of use cases and problems that arise
5. Summary 
6. Reflection
